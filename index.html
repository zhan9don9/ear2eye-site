      <p class="mt-2">
        We start in sound alone. In the womb it’s heartbeat, breath, a mother’s voice—short pulses that come and go.
        Early life copies that rhythm: a cry, a coo, a one-beat call. Most creatures do the same—one clear shape of sound per message, fast to make, hard to confuse.
        Babies echo it with ba, ma, da; our first words often stay one beat—“ma,” “pa,” “no,” even “god,” “dog,” “sun,” “moon.”
        A single beat can summon comfort or alarm, or tug for attention—but it cannot carry a whole story.
        To say more, we stack beats: ba-ba, ma-ma, hey-you. That is the first ladder up from simple to many.

        Very little survives from any time when speech stayed near one beat. What we do have are stories with names—and names stretch into more beats.
        In the garden you hear <em>Adam</em> (Hebrew ’Adam, <em>ah-DAHM</em>), <em>Eve</em> (Hebrew Chavah, <em>khah-VAH</em>), a <em>serpent</em> (Hebrew <em>nachash</em>, <em>na-KHASH</em>), and <em>fruit</em> (Hebrew <em>pri</em>, <em>pree</em>).
        Those extra beats do new work: they mark who, what, and how—roles, motives, relations. Not just “hey!” but “Eve listens; Adam answers; the serpent speaks.”

      <h2 class="font-semibold">What “vocal language” means</h2>
      <p class="mt-2">
        A voice makes a sound; a mind gives it content. Human vocal language is the collection of links between sounds and meanings—who/what/when/why packed into beats.
        A single beat can mean “come,” two beats can name “Adam,” a longer shape can carry “forbidden.” These links are learned, shared, and stackable:
        we agree on them, remember them, and chain them into lines. That’s enough to move from cries to stories.

      <p class="mt-2">
        Writing lets us see speech. Two routes: meaning→shape (characters) and sound→letters (spelling).
        Letters and spelled words likely rise with the multi-syllable stage: when speech is mostly one beat, there isn’t much sequence to record.
        As voices gain more beats and finer timing, the ear produces many word-shapes; letters are a compact toolkit to rebuild any sound.
        More syllables in the mouth create pressure for recombining symbols on the page.

      <div class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6">
        <p><strong>Claim (plain):</strong> Vocal language starts as one beat—a single syllable.</p>
        <p><strong>Why this is natural:</strong> Most vocal animals call in short, simple bursts (one shape of sound per message). It’s fast, easy to repeat, and hard to confuse.</p>
        <p><strong>Human echo:</strong> Babies first make single-syllable sounds (ba, ma, da). Early words often stick to one beat (“ma,” “pa,” “no,” names, “god,” “dog,” “sun,” “moon,” etc.).</p>
        <p><strong>Limits of one beat:</strong> One syllable can carry emotion (alarm, comfort, come, go) and attention (“hey!”), but not rich detail.</p>
        <p><strong>Step to growth:</strong> Repeating or chaining beats (ba-ba, ma-ma, hey-you) is the first ladder from single to many.</p>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Working note:</strong> We’re not saying humans “used to be animals.” We’re saying the simplest usable voice unit is one beat, and many species (including us, at first) use it.</p>

        Writing maps sounds → marks so a voice can be read with the eyes.
        Two broad routes: <strong>meaning → shape</strong> (characters) and <strong>sound → letters</strong> (spelling).
        Letters likely rise with a multi-syllable stage; characters fit the one-beat, concrete-naming stage, then compound later.

      <div class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6">
        To spell speech, we must see its pieces. A syllable has a vowel core and consonant edges (onset/coda).
        Common shapes: CV (ma), CVC (sun), CCV (play). In a one-beat era there’s little sequence to analyze.
        As multi-syllable speech grows, patterns repeat and people can analyze them—then letters make sense.
        Even today, everyday speech draws on <em>hundreds</em> of syllables in many languages (e.g., Mandarin ≈ 400 without tones).
        <br><br>
        <strong>Japanese kana:</strong> sound-connected at the syllable/beat level, but consonant and vowel are <em>bundled</em> (か=ka, き=ki…).  
        <strong>English spelling:</strong> consonants and vowels are written separately (k+a → “ka”; s+u+n → “sun”).

      <summary class="font-semibold">Characters: single beat → rich shape</summary>
      <div class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6">
        In everyday Mandarin, one character ≈ one syllable—matching a single-beat stage.
        If speech mostly came one beat at a time, a meaning→shape script fits: each beat gets its own sign, and the sign can be rich (many strokes) to carry meaning.
        Later, as speech grows multi-syllable, characters join to make longer words; the one-character, one-beat habit remains as a strong pattern.

      <summary class="font-semibold">Concrete → Abstract</summary>
      <div class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6">
        Early writing leans on things with shape (sun, moon, tree, man). As language grows, we must talk about what has no shape (time, duty, cause, if, truth).
        Two moves follow: combine pictures to hint at ideas, and spell sounds with letters so any abstract word can be built when no picture fits.
        Pictures carry the seen world; spelling carries the unseen.

      <div class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6">
        A tone changes a syllable’s shape in the ear. In Mandarin, <em>mā / má / mǎ / mà</em> are four different words on the same “ma.”
        By layering tones over a small set of base syllables, ancestors multiplied the inventory without adding beats, letting a single-syllable era last longer.
        In writing, this shows up as <strong>multiple characters</strong> tied to the same base syllable (often tone- and meaning-distinct), not “one character per syllable.”

        Think of scripts on two switches: (1) Nature ↔ Not-nature — do marks look like things? (2) Sound ↔ Not-sound — do marks track how we say them?  
        <strong>Chinese characters:</strong> nature-connected, not-sound-connected (meaning first; phonetic hints exist but are secondary).  
        <strong>Alphabetic spelling:</strong> not-nature-connected, sound-connected (abstract letters rebuild how a word is said).  
        <strong>Japanese kana:</strong> not-nature-connected, sound-connected at the <em>syllable</em> level; consonant + vowel are bundled inside each kana.

    <details id="exp-babel" class="card">
      <summary class="font-semibold">Why speech needs convention (Babel)</summary>
      <div class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6">
        A spoken language isn’t the world’s noises—it’s an agreed mapping from sounds to meanings.
        Most things have no sound to borrow; the few that do we often don’t use (English says <em>cat</em>, not <em>meow</em>).
        Even imitations are conventional: a rooster is “cock-a-doodle-doo” (EN), “kikeriki” (DE), “コケコッコー” (JP).
        Choosing and stabilizing pairings is a hard social task—habit, teaching, authority—so myths invoke divine action, like Babel, to explain the split of tongues.

      <summary class="font-semibold">Phonetic under divine authority; characters de-sacralize (thesis)</summary>
      <div class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6">
        To bind sounds→meanings and keep them stable, communities lean on divine authority.
        Phonetic systems serve this: letters fix the voice under scripture and chant, centralize doctrine, and let temples/courts guard sacred meaning across time.
        In this frame, science is also divine—a way to approach the Creator; institutions defend that charge, while “secular science” is an unintended side effect.
        By contrast, character systems (meaning→shape) weaken priestly monopoly: the sign points to meaning rather than a fixed sound, inviting multiple readings and local drift.
        Across China (and neighbors), this deprived temples and courts of divine power; authority flowed into bureaucracy and exams instead of a sacred magisterium.
