# Ear2Eye — Dong Zhang

Ear2Eye is Dong Zhang’s small lab. We think in two languages—Ear & Eye. A history pendulum explains an Ear-heavy past and today’s Eye-ward turn; in math we pair rigorous proof with a spine-figure. Physics: continuous vs discrete. Two works: (1) Schrödinger’s Cat & birthdays of atoms/photons; (2) Young’s double slit with a DIY asymmetric slit. hello@ear2eye.org
